# New Tab

A Firefox extension that displays a new tab page with my name and some useful links.

## Installation

This extension has not been published to the Mozilla App Store. You will need to run it as a temporary add-on. 

To install this extension as a temporary add-on, first clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/capjamesg/newtab
```

Next, navigate to the Firefox debugging page in your browser:

```
about:debugging
```

On the debugging page, click "This Firefox" in the sidebar. Click "Temporary Extensions" and then "Load Temporary Add-On". Navigate to the `newtab` folder that you cloned from GitHub and click on any file.

The extension will now be visible as your new tab page.

## Publish as an Extension
